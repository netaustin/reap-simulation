                    <h1>About the Re-entry Simulation</h1>
                    <p>The Reentry Simulation was originally developed as an in-person experience, through a community wide effort led by the United States Department of Justice. Thanks to their work, the in-person simulation materials have been made free for facilitators around the country, who then help participants learn about the struggles and challenges faced by individuals who are transitioning from incarceration back into society.</p>
                    <p>In 2021, due to campus restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, an in-person simulation was not possible. Austin Smith developed this computer simulation using the core concepts of the in-person simulation as his capstone project for the <a href="https://courses.business.columbia.edu/b8580">Re-entry Acceleration Program Immersion</a> course at Columbia Business School. It has been used both at Columbia and the Wharton School of Business in programs for MBA students since then.</p>
                    <p>The goal of this simulation is for participants to gain an understanding of the significant obstacles faced by men and women attempting to navigate the system upon their release from incarceration and returning home to their communities. To walk in the shoes of one who is returning home gives invaluable insight for professionals who are tasked with and/or are able to help those individuals achieve a successful reentry.</p>
